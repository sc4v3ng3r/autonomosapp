# Aut√¥nomosApp

Autonomosapp is a mobile flutter application working on Android and iOS platforms. The app main bussines is make possible your users announce and/or find users that provide some kind of freelancer service inside the city of who is making the search. 

The app reach your beta version but unhappily the project and the app was abandoned. I was able to start and learn flutter writing this app so I decide share the code for future references about how I should do some feature and of course how I shouldn't. This app has Firebase as backend service and GoogleMaps API since there is no release key of this app it will not work if you try to clone and run the project, so **this repository is just for code reference and nothing more**. 

## Features used in app
 * Firebase Realtime database
 * Firebase Authentication with Facebook integration
 * Firebase Storage 
 * Google Maps
